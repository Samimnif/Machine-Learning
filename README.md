# Machine Learning Experiments
## Introduction
This repository has mostly all the examples and experiments that I wrote for my learning purposes only.
<br>
In this documentation, there are three sections for ML: _**Supervised**_ and _**Unsupervised**_ learning.
<br><br>
_**Supervised** learning_ will include two experiments which are Regression and Classification experiment.
