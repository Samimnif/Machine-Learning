# Machine Learning Experiments
## Introduction
This repository has mostly all the examples and experiments that I wrote for my learning purposes only.
<br>
In this documentation, there are three sections for ML: _**Supervised**_, _**Unsupervised**_ learning, _**AutoML**_ and _**Final Project**_.
<br><br>
_**Supervised** learning_ will include two experiments: Regression and Classification experiment.<br>
_**Unsupervised** learning_ will include two experiments: Clustering and Anamoly experiment.<br>
_**AutoML**_ will be an overview of the AutoML experiment and its uses.<br>
_**Final Project**_ is for final practice to make sure the material was understood and to also explore the uses of ML in the real-world.
